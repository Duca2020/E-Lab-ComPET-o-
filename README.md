# E-Lab-ComPETção

In this project, my team—consisting of myself, Francisco do Carmo Amorim, along with Marcos Gabriel dos Santos Carneiro and Arthur Israel Gonçalves—developed an interactive Python program to engage students with data in a hands-on, accessible way. The program includes data management, statistical analysis, process control, and server access scripts, and it interfaces with an ESP32 microcontroller connected to an ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement. 

We demonstrated that the program runs smoothly on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, allowing students to adjust parameters interactively via keyboard or mouse. This setup enables schools and universities to conduct fundamental experiments in physics and chemistry, simply by modifying the source code and using suitable sensors, which represents a cost-effective and sustainable alternative for institutions with limited physical and financial resources.

Our innovation earned 1st place in the 2024 ComPETção. We are now refining the program and setup to present it to local organizations, with plans to implement it in schools and universities.
